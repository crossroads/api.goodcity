  I can apply to an orders package through the API

  Scenario: For inactive orders

    Then They should have no actions available

  Scenario: For active orders with designated orders_package
    Given I have Orders with states of type: "ACTIVE_STATES"
    And Their OrdersPackages are of state "designated"
    Then They should have the "edit_quantity|cancel|dispatch" actions enabled

  Scenario: For active orders with partially dispatched orders_package
    Given I have Orders with states of type: "ACTIVE_STATES"
    And Their OrdersPackages are of state "designated"
    And Their OrdersPackages are partially dispatched
    Then They should have the "dispatch|undispatch" actions enabled

      | designated 	 | 1                    | 1                   | 2                 |
