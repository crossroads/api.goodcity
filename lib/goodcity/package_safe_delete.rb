#
# For a given inventory_number, this will
#   - delete all packages with that number and their associated package_locations,
#     orders_packages, images, requested_packages and inventory_number  
#   - request updated information from Stockit to recreate a good package
# Note: destroy and delete have significant differences here.
#   - destroy will remove a row from the database and run callbacks to update stockit
#     and other parts of the system
#   - delete will remove the row from the database but avoid running any other callbacks
# Usage:
#   require 'goodcity/package_safe_delete'
#   Goodcity::PackageSafeDelete.new('123245').run
#   Goodcity::PackageSafeDelete.new(['111111', '222222']).run
