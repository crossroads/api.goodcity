    Please take careful note of the steps below and contact us if you have any questions.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Our staff will call your beneficiary just before ordering the van to re-confirm that everything is in place for receiving the goods.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To avoid unnecessary van costs we will not usually proceed until we have successfully made contact.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we cannot reach your beneficiary we may need to cancel the order.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      We will usually call a second time when the van leaves our site to flag that the goods are on their way and provide you with the driver’s contact number.
    </li>
    <li>
      The driver will be given your beneficiary’s number so they are able to make contact directly if they have difficulty finding the exact location.
    </li>
  </ol>
