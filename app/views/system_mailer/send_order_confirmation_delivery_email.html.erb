Dear {{contact_name}},

RE: Confirming order {{order_code}} to be delivered on {{scheduled_at}}

Thank you for ordering items from Crossroads. We are delighted to help in any way that we can.

Please take careful note of the steps below and contact us if you have any questions.
Our staff will call your beneficiary just before ordering the van to re-confirm that everything is in place for receiving the goods.
To avoid unnecessary van costs we will not usually proceed until we have successfully made contact.
If we cannot reach your beneficiary we may need to cancel the order.
We will usually call a second time when the van leaves our site to flag that the goods are on their way and provide you with the driver’s contact number.
The driver will be given your beneficiary’s number so they are able to make contact directly if they have difficulty finding the exact location.
